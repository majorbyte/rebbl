        This new team follows the same rules for buying players and skills as any new team. The new team may be of a different race if so desired, but still must be unique to the clan. If the new team is the same race as the original team, a single player from the original roster may be kept as a legacy player. This legacy player costs the same in gold as he is listed as valued in-game. This legacy player counts towards the number of superstars on the new team (as the team’s first superstar, although his 10k superstar tax is considered part of the price paid for him already). The legacy player also counts towards the number of statistic increased players AND number of doubles players (if the legacy player has any stats or doubles). For instance, a legacy +ST and +AG dorf runner with dodge and sidestep would thus consume both the statistic and double quota of the new blood:ed Dorf team. He would still be legal, however, as he earned those stats and doubles the hard way! A second superstar on that Dorf team would cost 20k tax, a third 30k, etc, as per the rules on superstars.

        Please use the ledger from the start of the season, and make sure you list the correct name on a legacy player and list the actual value of this player as cost. Please use the separate New Blood tab in the ledger, where the potential legacy player has a separate spot at the top for cost, rolls selected and skill-ups! After the ledger comes to the same price as the previous team, create the team in-game according to the new team rules. The new team ledger (and in-game team created) must be provided within 48 hours of the match being over to the admin team for review.

        NOTE: If you miss the first deadline, the power use is not counted. If you miss the second deadline, then the power will be processed one round later than intended. If you are drafting before the New Blood! has been fully validated, then the power will not be processed until one round later than intended.

        You cannot switch tiers upwards when using this power, if you move downwards a tier you DO NOT receive any tax rebate associated with that tier. You cannot use this power on a team that started the season under 1100 TV.

Roll a d6 using the discord dice bot. On a roll of a 2+ the assigned player is injured during the assassination attempt and must miss the next match! Sadly, the quality of assassins (or the toughness of Blood Bowl players!) these days mean they leave no permanent injury. This is handled by an admin game being used to apply an MNG injury to the player in question. 

        If you roll a 1, the assassin is interrupted during his task by a random player on the opposing team and attacks them instead! Randomly determine a player on the opposing team WHO WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL TARGET to receive an MNG instead. 

        This power cannot be used to target a player that has already been a target of assassination (either directly, or indirectly) earlier in the season. Assassin’s have too much professional pride to take sloppy seconds! Granted, if the same team is targeted and a 1 is rolled, the same player could accidentally be assassinated instead of the targeted teammate if they are unlucky enough.`

        The injury will then be changed into an MNG by a Clan League Admin instead. The game cannot be confirmed in order to be used, so coaches are responsible for pressing “NO” when asked to confirm the game, if you intend to request this power or are considering using it. This power cannot be prevented by using Miscommunication!.
