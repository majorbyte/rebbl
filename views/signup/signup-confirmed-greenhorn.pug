      p The Greenhorn Cup is a swiss tournament before the seasons starts with two aims in mind, one to give coaches something to do, while waiting on the season to start as well as giving the teams a leg up into the season.
      p The Greenhorn Cup is specifically for fresh teams, so if you come from the ReBBRL minors, don't sign up for The Greenhorn Cup
      p You can read more about the rules here soon :
